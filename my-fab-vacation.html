<h1>My Fabulous Vacation</h1>
<h2>Location: Glacier National Park</h2>
<p>Recently, I went on a vacation to <b><i><a href="http://www.nps.gov/glac/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Glacier National Park</a></i> in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Glacier+National+Park/@48.7596128,-113.7892112,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x5368901555555555:0xaf16bc2215c55dec" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Montana</b></a>.</p>

<p>The plan was to do a 10 day long hiking/camping trip. With the potential to encounter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bears</li>
<li>Wolves</li>
<li>Moose</li>
<li>Deer</li>
</ul>
<p>and much more, this was already a pretty wild (vacation)! However, little did I know that it was going to be completely out of this world....
</p>
<p>While hiking in a remote part of the park I encountered Richard Simmons!</p>

<p>Obviously, I was shocked to see him dashing through the park - especially with no one else around. At first I thought maybe he was exercising but as he zipped by I could tell something wasn't right.</p>
<h3>He looked terrified!</h3>
<p>I yelled after him, <i>"Is everything okay?!"</i><br>
<i>"She's after me!"</i> he shrieked. And then he was gone.</p>
<p>I had <b>no</b> idea what to think. I thought about running after him but he was moving <u>way</u> too fast. Plus I would probably just end up completely lost.</p>
<p>So I kept going.</p>
<p>It was only about 5 minutes later I saw someone else dashing along the path. At first I thought I was really going crazy because (and you'll never believe this) it was Martha Stewart!</p>
<p><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/uvmm2c2ynujvfxd/martha-stewart-image.jpg?dl=0" /></p>
<p>And she was holding a huge frosted cupcake.</p>
<p><i>"What are you doing here?!"</i> I exclaimed.<br>
<i>"Trying to force Simmons to eat a cupcake... he hasn't had a carb in 30 years and that needs to change!"</i> she declared, not even slowing down.</p>
<p>And then she too disappeared.</p>

<p>You don't even want to know who I saw when I got back to town...</p>
