<h2>Why Puppy Problems?</h2>
<p>Puppy Problems was created because puppies are adorable... until they aren't. Meaning there's nothing adorable about a dog that continually uses the bathroom in the house, chews your shoes like he hasn't had anything to eat in a week, guards his resources, and appears to take great pleasure in doing the opposite of what you tell him.</p>
<p>Not only is this <strong>incredibly</strong> frustrating it is also potentially dangerous for you and your dog. Thing about it.... Do you think it is healthy for your dog to eat shoes, socks, and other items in your home that are <strong>not</strong> edible? Do you think it is safe for your dog to growl and potentially even snap when you, another person, or another dog approaches his bowl or favorite toy?</p>
<h3>The answer is no.</h3>
<p>When humans and dogs can't live in harmony there are a couple of potential outcomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The human sends the dog to a shelter or to live with another family. Chances are the dog does not get a good loving family because of his behavioral problems.</li>
<li>The dog's problems get worse. How bad could it get? The dog could bite another human or animal and has to be put down.</li>
<li> The human and dog live in a ultra tense relationship where neither is happy.</li>
</ul>
<h3>These may all seem like worst case scenarios but they happen. Too frequently.</h3>
<p><span class="important">The best time to address your puppy's bad behaviors or quirks is when they are young!</span</p>
<h2>So Welcome to Puppy Problems</h2>
<p>Puppy Problems is a user driven community focused on providing the resources you need to get a happy and healthy puppy. It is also a place for you to voice concerns you may have about your puppy and his or her training progress or behaviors.</p>
<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, Puppy Problems is user driven. This means that all the problems, answers, resources, etc. are provided by members of the community. We're all incredibly supportive. We want to help you and your puppy. Hopefully you'll feel the same way and share your resources, feedback, encouragement, etc. with other members.</p>
<p>Getting started is incredibly simple. You'll start by creating an account. To do so all you'll need to provide is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Username</li>
<li>Password</li>
<li>Email</li>
</ul>
<p>Once you have an account, you'll have the opportunity to customize your profile with additional information about you and your puppy. However, if you want to remain anonymous for now that's totally fine. We'll be friends soon enough!</p> 
<p>As soon as you have an account, you're free to start asking questions, sharing resources, or trying to answer questions. Simply start a new thread or select one from our home page and start reading!</p>
<h2>The Rules</h2>
<p>We don't have a lot of rules on Puppy Problems. However, a few things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be polite - No swearing, derogatory comments, etc. If you act like a troll you will be removed!</li>
<li>Be helpful - Don't just show up and lurk or ask questions without ever giving back. This community can't thrive without your help. Provide support or answers whenever you can.</li>
<li>Be honest - While we want our members to be as involved as possible, if you don't know something say so. Don't lie or guess at someone else's problem.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="important">Lastly, if we suspect you of any kind of animal abuse or neglect you will be reported to the proper authorities.</span></p>
