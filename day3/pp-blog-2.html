<h2>Puppy Problems Webinar: Be on Guard for Resource Guarding</h2>
<p>When a dog displays resource guarding tendencies as a puppy it can lead to more harmful or even dangerous behavior as an adult. Resource guarding can include being possessive of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Food or treats</li>
<li>A particular toy (or toys)</li>
<li>A spot such as a bed or feeding area</li>
<li>An individual</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically, resource guarding is when your dog acts possessive any thing, place, or person.</p>
<h3>Signs of Resource Guarding</h3>
<p>Signs that a dog is being possessive of something can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Growling</li>
<li>Snapping</li>
<li>Going stiff</li>
<li>Whining</li>
</ul>
<p>Basically any sign of distress or aggression when you approach the item, place, or person your dog is guarding</p>
<h3>Resource guarding is <strong>very</strong> common</h3>
<p>It is common because in the wild, if your dog didn't resource guard he or she wouldn't survive. However, it is not "polite" or "healthy" behavior for dogs that live with humans.</p>
<p><span class="important">The best time to address your puppy's resource guarding is when they are young!</span></p>
